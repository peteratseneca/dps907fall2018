#  Web API Get example

Shows the ability to use a web API to fetch data. 

A `WebApiRequest.swift` source code file has a class for a "request".  
A WebApiRequest object is instantiated in a manager class (extension).  
The object is configured with a URL and any variable data for the URL.  
An expected response data type is provided, as is a completion handler function (closure).  

The `DataModelClasses.swift` source code file has structs  
that define the *shape* of the response data.
